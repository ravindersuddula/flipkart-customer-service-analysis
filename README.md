Customer service data analysis to improve retention at Flipkart using Excel

# 📞 Flipkart Customer Service Analysis – Excel Dashboard Project

### 📌 Problem Statement
Flipkart, a major Indian e-commerce platform, recently observed a **decline in customer retention**. Since **customer service quality directly impacts customer experience**, this project investigates whether inefficiencies in the support process are contributing to low satisfaction and increased churn.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
To analyze customer call center data and uncover patterns in **customer sentiment, response time, support channels, and query types** that impact **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**. The goal is to provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve service quality and ultimately increase retention.

## 🧪 Hypotheses Tested

| Hypothesis | Insight |
|-----------|---------|
| Sentiment predicts CSAT | ✅ Strong correlation (Very Positive → CSAT 9.18, Very Negative → CSAT 2.17) |
| Call duration impacts CSAT | ❌ Weak correlation (r = -0.006) |
| SLA adherence affects CSAT | ❌ Minimal impact — quality matters more than speed |
| Query type (Billing/Payment) affects CSAT | ❌ Similar CSAT scores across categories |
| Day-of-week load affects CSAT | ❌ Volume doesn’t affect CSAT significantly |
| Support channel affects CSAT | ❌ Similar CSAT across Call, Chatbot, Email, Web |
| Call center load affects CSAT | ⚠️ High-load centers like Mumbai show slightly lower CSAT |

## 📊 Excel Dashboard Highlights

- KPIs for: **Avg. CSAT**, **Call Duration**, **Response Time**, **Query Type**
- Interactive filtering by **Sentiment**, **Support Channel**, **Call Center**
- Visuals: Bar charts, pivot tables, correlation graphs

---

## 🧠 Key Insights & Recommendations

- 🧾 **71% of queries are billing-related** → Automate routine billing processes
- 😠 **51% of responses are Negative/Very Negative sentiment** → Prioritize follow-up and root-cause analysis
- 📞 **Call Center handles 32% of volume** → Focus on agent training for empathy & quality
- 💬 **Feedback rate is low** → Improve CSAT data collection methods (e.g., better surveys)

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (EDA, pivot tables, charts, KPIs)
- PowerPoint / PDF (final insights presentation)

---

## ✅ Conclusion
While CSAT scores remain largely consistent across query types, channels, and SLA categories, **sentiment** emerged as the most **actionable signal**. This project demonstrates how Excel can be used to deliver real business insights and support strategic decisions using simple yet effective data analysis techniques.
